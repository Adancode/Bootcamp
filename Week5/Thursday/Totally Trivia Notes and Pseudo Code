Totally Trivia Notes and Pseudo Code

Create a function, generateHTML(), that is triggered by the start button, and generates the HTML seen on the project video...

We need the generateHTML() function to generate this:
	
	timerFunc(): A function that counts down from 30 to 0, if the counter hits zero, the question is counted as incorrect, I replace the answers with an "out of time!" statement (as opposed to the incorrect statement), followed by the correct answer, and an image below. after a 3 second pause generateHTML() is run again.

	Time Remaining: (the counter for the timerFunc() is displayed here)

	Question: (the current question is displayed here)

	Four divs that contain the possible answers (onclick, these divs run another function, testAnswer(), which:
		runs the content of the div against the appropriate answer, and...
			if correct, replaces the answers with a "correct!" statement followed by the correct answer, and an image below.

				there should then be a break of 3 seconds, and the generateHTML() function should run

			if incorrect, replaces the answers with an "incorrect!" statement followed by the correct answer, and an image below.

Create a function, timerFunc() that counts down from 30 seconds to zero...

IF the timerFunc() counter hits zero, I run the generateHTML() function again, with new variables.

There should be an incorrect() function and a correct() function.

There should be 8 total questions
The correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered questions should all be tracked, and loaded with a generateScoreHTML() function, which runs when the answerCount variable = 8, superceding the usual generateHTML() function.

There should be a start over button which clears all variables and runs generateHTML();
